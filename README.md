# DYNAMIC MIXTURE LCCM

### Four key features:
  - Dynamic structure of LCCM. The classmembership in LCCM is represented in Dynamic LCCM by one initial matrix and one class transition model. The framework is based on heterogeneous hidden markov model with mixture emission model.
  - Mixture choice models. Multiple choice models are accomodated. Each choice model is assumed to be conditionally independent on the class membership. The type of choice model is also flexible to be defined for users based on their own needs.
  - Allow multiple sequences of observations with same number of time steps.
  - Three model structures are provided, from the basic one to more advanced. Users can make their own choice considering their own computation power.
